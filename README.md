# DeFi Attack Analysis

This repository analyzes key information on DeFi hacks, scams and exploits. Using data obtained from DEFIYIELD's REKT database on the 200 costliest attacks on DeFi services, as well as data from DefiLlama's TVL database on the total value locked across various chains, this report explores what types attacks are most prevalent in DeFi as a whole, as well as on individual chains, in order to identify where cybersecurity and scam prevention efforts would best be focused. My ultimate goal in creating this report is to help build a safe and secure decentralized finance ecosystem so that it may one day be widely adopted.
